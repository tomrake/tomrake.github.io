I follow a series of legal, national security and political types on twitter and many are moving to mastodon.
Last night I was feeling I did not get the information I desired all the posts etc.
Mastodon is not heavy on the recommendation engine, if there is one.
You are the algorithm.

About 15 years ago I was frustrated with Facebook why did it send me stuff and how do I find that stuff again.
On Facebook the users are the product, your attention is marketed to advertisers.

In the past I have used Twitter to review releases of other long form information web postings from government and companies.
I would follow those entities and get the latest information to review.

The MAGA King choose Twitter as the platform of 2016 to 2021.
I began to follow MAGA and anti MAGA sources.
Eventually I found a series of sources to follow on legal, national security, military and government policy, Twitter became  hot.
I liked what the Twitter algorithm sent to me.

Twitter has had a difficult time being profitable.
The Billionaire Rocketman purchased Twitter with a billion dollar non refundable deal, he the sued in Delaware and lost.
His first efforts were to drag the Twitter machinery through the sandy mud by firing people by email and then regretting is a few days later.
The people I value on Twitter started joining mastodon.

<h2 id="orgf48d339">Where is the Mastodon algorithm</h2>

My conclusion this morning is on Mastodon we build our own suggestion feed.
This has implications for many of us.
On Twitter I would often ignore many of the thread comments, how do even see these on Mastodon.
Are there comment threads?
