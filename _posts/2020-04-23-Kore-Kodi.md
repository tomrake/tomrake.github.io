# COVID-19 requires me to reloacate

# My setup the hardware

- Kodi running on a  Raspberry Pi, wired link to a home router
- Kore an App running on an Android phone connected via wireless.

# My configuration

- Kodi Remote Server is configure on a local IP address at port 8080, User Name and Password.
- Kore a Remote Client is configured to use the above server address, port, name and pw.

# The Kore problem

One moring my Kore remote stopped working due to a crashed home router.
The main symptom other than non-function was that the Kore - Media Center (selected from the left hamburger) icon had RED icon.
This icon should be GREEN when the client can connect to the server.
When connecting the icon may be YELLOW.

# What you need to keep nearby

You need the IP, port, login name and pw for the Kodi Remote server. This should allow you to open connections from the Kore app to the Kodi server.

# NOTES:
I only use stock Kodi software, or software I have modified for testing,
please do not ask me how to modify Kodi for any nefarious purpose.
