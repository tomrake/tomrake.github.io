During an introductory computer class at Lehigh in the fall of 1976, a fellow student scribbled the following lines on the margin of his notebook.
I interpreted this as a series of punch cards of the university's batch system.
#+begin_example
LOGIN, A1234
REWIND
BATCH INPUT
#+end_example

The CDC SCOPE commands for the University's CDC 6400.
The card sequence was read as an input file.
- Line one, the login authentication.
- Line two, the input file is rewound to the beginning.
- Line three, the rewound file is sent to the system input queue.
Rinse, lather, repeat.
  
I recall this sequence of events.
The previous day, the "fellow student" had executed the three punch card sequence,  a self-propagating program.
At the remote system, the communications would go dead.
He asked me what they thought, I blew him off during class.
He asked me what they thought, and I blew him off during class. Later that day, he repeated it and was caught by LUCC staff, not liking their system being crashed. 
Weeks later, the "fellow student" had a job cleaning out the computer paper waste bins at the computer center.
