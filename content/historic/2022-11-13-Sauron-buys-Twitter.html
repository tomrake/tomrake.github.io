In a report from the Bree Daily, Sauron, of Mordor, has reportedly paid 44 Billion Dollars in exchange for a Seer Stone called "Twitter",
a dollar being some odd foreign currency made of paper.
</p>

<p>
Mayor Sam Gamgee, of Bag End, has been quoted that
"he knows nothing of any of Sauron's latest dealings" but
is "quite certain that no Rings of Power are involved."
</p>

<p>
None of the other hobbit Adventurers could be reached for comment.

<li>The Inn at Bree has collected a great number of oddly colored checkmarks.</li>
<li>Mayor Sam Gamgee's daughter Elanor has won the tight rope walking contest.</li>
<li>Rumors still abound at the Green Dragon Tavern about the missing Frodo Baggins.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This report was updated to correct the spelling of Sam Gamgee's name.
